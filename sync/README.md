These are the scripts used to sync and distribute MWF to the CENIC AWS Distrobution Master servers

The two directories are:
<pre>
        hosts           - scripts to pull and configure distrobution servers for production and stage purposes
        sync            - scripts used to sync distrobution servers to production and stage servers
</pre>

The current stage bastion host is ec2-204-236-146-119.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
The current production bastion host is ec2-184-169-243-140.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
